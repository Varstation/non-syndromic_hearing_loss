In this study, we aim to assess frequencies of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with non-syndromic hearing loss in a cohort of Brazilian patients referred to genome sequencing. Based on these data, we intend to estimate the overall population frequency of non-syndromic hearing loss.
